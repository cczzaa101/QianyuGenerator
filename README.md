Thing that makes some Chinese context full of typo.
using: pypinyin and google ime
to run it, you shall:
1. be out of GFW, otherwise it will be blocked
2. install pypinyin by:
    pip install pypinyin
It's slow and ugly written, because it's just a program written by a python noob within 2 hours.
Feel free to use,improve and share it!

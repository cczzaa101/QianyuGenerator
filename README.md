Thing that makes some Chinese context full of typo. <br />
Using: pypinyin and google ime<br />
To run it, you shall: <br />
    1. be out of GFW, otherwise it will be blocked<br />
    2. install pypinyin by: <br />
        pip install pypinyin<br />
It's slow and ugly written, because it's just a program written by a python noob within 2 hours.<br />
Feel free to use,improve and share it!
